理想情况:

- machine A just puts the bits on the wire
- machine B just takes them off

但是现实情况并不是这样,因为 **communication channels** make errors occasionally。

具体表现在于

- **communication channels** have only a **finite data rate**
- **propagation delay** between the time a bit is sent and the time it is received

那么如何应对这些 **limitations** 呢？
