# Exercise 5. Memorizing C Operators

How I want you to learn C is to first memorize all the basic symbols and syntax

## The List of Operators:

### arithmetic operators 算数运算符:

### Bitwise operators 位运算符:

Bitwise operators do something you likely won’t experience often in modern code.

They `alter the bits` that make up bytes and other data types in various ways

### Assignment operators 赋值操作符:

Assignment operators simply `assign expressions to variables`, but C combines a large number of other operators with assignment
